<h1 class="question">Time?</h1>

<p class="intro">Often people will criticize time travel in stories, debating whether it's possible, why the hero or antagonist didn't travel to some other point in time to change things, or why the characters have no memory of certain events. To these people I suggest watching the Justice League Unlimited episode <mark>"Once and Future Thing"</mark> or (pun unintended) if time permits <mark>Chrono Cross</mark> and <mark>Chrono Trigger</mark>.</p>

<p class="jlu">"The Once and Future Thing" is about a man who steals through time to take small trinkets only to end up warping time all together after his fragile psyche breaks. Its a rather amazing episode that focuses on Wonder Woman, Batman, and Green Lantern traveling into the past and future as time and space gets delightfully twisted. It has some great humor, dark moments, and is one of my favorite episodes from that series.</p>

<p class="chrono">Chrono Trigger and it's sequel Chrono Cross are also stories that deal with time travel and what if scenarios. Because they are games rather than an episode, they give players an opportunity to explore these themes in-depth. I don't want to spoil you too much! But as you journey with your space/time heroes, you can easily see cause and effect, or maybe more appropriately butterfly effect, in the present as you change the past and future. Chrono Trigger is widely considered one of the best RPGs of all time (and features artwork by the lengendary <mark>Akira Toriyama</mark> of Dragon Ball fame and excellent music by <mark>Yasunori Mitsuda</mark>) for good reason! Chrono Trigger takes the themes from Trigger to it's to extreme.</p>

<p class="outro">In any case, these are unforgettable stories that I urge anyone to look into, if they do not want to watch or play these stories. After all, the journey is what matters most.</p>
