    blockquote class for blockquote
    you can add -reverse onto blockquote??? -->

    <p class="lead">If you can't tell already, I'm a big fan of video games, <mark style= "color: indigo">Final Fantasy</mark> in particular. Video games are a unique medium that mixes programming, art, music, and audio (sound design) with writing, but also manages to provide agency to whomever is playing the game. I love playing them, new or old. In fact, when I'm not studying web development (lasering in on javascript at this time) I'm playing <mark style= "color: indigo">Skyrim</mark> on the PS4 or <mark style= "color: indigo">Morrowind</mark> on PC.</p>

    <p>Other games that I play that hope to be influenced by are:</p>

    <div class="container">

        <!-- "list-inline" aligns this with the blockquote
        "list-inline-item" puts all the items on one line -->
        <ul class="list-inline">

            <p><li>Odin Sphere</li></p>

            <p><li>Final Fantasy VII</li></p>

            <p><li>Final Fantasy XII (Zodiac Age)</li></p>

            <p><li>Streets of Rage</li></p>

            <p><li>Horizon Zero Dawn</li></p>

            <p><li>Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen</li></p>

            <p><li>Monster Hunter World</li></p>

        </ul>

    </div>

    <p>There's more to life than just games. I also enjoy drawing and sketching, reading, writing, and photography! Photography and digital photo manipulation (i.e. Photoshop) and digital art is another passion of mine. I even have an image bank, admittedly, it's lame (shots of pets, family, and KC), but I never hurt for images in an emergency!</p>
    
    <p>Here's some shots I took over the last few months.</p>

    <div class="images">

        <!-- "image-fluid" shifts the image around the page depending on the size of the window 
        -thumbnail adds a slight border to the image
        to set width and height, simply write and equal to the desired percentage size
        -->
        <img class="image-fluid img-thumbnail" width=25% height=25% src="images/Lancelot1.JPG" alt="world's cutest cat"/>

        <img class="image-fluid img-thumbnail" width=25% height=25% src="images/Lancelot2.JPG" alt="world's cutest cat again"/>

    </br>

        <img class="image-fluid img-thumbnail" width=25% height=25% src="images/Lancelot3.JPG" alt="world's cutest cat yet again"/>

        <img class="image-fluid img-thumbnail img-align=bottom" width=25% height=25% src="images/Lancelot4.JPG" alt="the cat is still cute"/>
